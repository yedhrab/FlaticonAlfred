# FlatIcon Client

- Simple FlatIcon Client for that I use for my own projects

## 🤔 How It's Work?

- Search `query` on flaticon (for more specific settings, change shape or order_by in `main.py`)
- Creates `flaticon` folder to `HOME` directory and store every query it's own folder
- Download all image results if it's not exists
